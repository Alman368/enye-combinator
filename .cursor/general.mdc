## üìä Data Context

### What Data We're Visualizing
- **Primary Mental Health Diagnoses** from hospitals
- Categories: Depression, Anxiety, Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, PTSD, etc.
- **Time-series data**: Track trends over weeks, months, years
- **Hospital information**: Multiple hospitals across different regions
- **Patient demographics**: Age groups, gender (anonymized)

### Data Sources
- Hospital diagnostic records
- Mental health assessment databases
- Standardized diagnostic codes (ICD-10, DSM-5)

---

## üéØ Core Features (Hackathon Requirements)

### 1. Dashboard (Priority: HIGH)
- **Overview statistics**: Total diagnoses, hospitals, categories
- **Key charts**:
  - Diagnoses over time (line chart)
  - Diagnoses by category (bar chart)
  - Distribution by hospital (pie chart)
- **Quick insights**: Recent trends, alerts, changes

### 2. Data Explorer (Priority: HIGH)
- **Advanced filtering**:
  - Date range selection
  - Hospital selection (multi-select)
  - Diagnosis category filtering
  - Age range, gender filters
- **Data table**: Sortable, paginated, searchable
- **Multiple visualizations**: Switch between chart types
- **Export functionality**: Download filtered data (CSV)

### 3. Reports (Priority: MEDIUM)
- **Report templates**: Monthly, hospital-wise, category-wise
- **Custom report builder**: Select metrics and filters
- **Export options**: PDF, CSV
- **Save/load reports**: For recurring analysis

### 4. Authentication (Priority: LOW - Implement LAST)
- Simple login page
- User roles: Admin, Researcher, Viewer
- Session management

## üí° Key Insights for AI Assistants

### When Writing Code
- **Think like a doctor**: Would a doctor understand this UI?
- **Prioritize clarity**: Clear labels > fancy animations
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Medical data is sensitive
- **Make it fast**: Doctors don't have time to wait
- **Test thoroughly**: Medical tools must be reliable

### When Making UI Decisions
- **Professional over trendy**: This is for hospitals
- **Accessible colors**: Colorblind-friendly palette
- **Readable fonts**: Larger, clear text
- **Whitespace**: Don't cram too much information
- **Consistent**: Same patterns throughout

### When Implementing Features
- **Start simple**: Get core functionality working first
- **Add complexity gradually**: Don't over-engineer
- **Test with real use cases**: How would a doctor use this?
- **Document clearly**: Others need to understand your code

## üìù Remember

**This application will be used by medical professionals to make important decisions about mental health care. Every feature should be designed with clarity, reliability, and ease of use in mind.**

**In a hackathon setting: FOCUS ON CORE FEATURES. Get visualizations working first. Make it beautiful. Make it easy. Make it work.**
